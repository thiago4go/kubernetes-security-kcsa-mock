## **📂 Database Management (SQLite)**  

The application now **stores and manages questions in SQLite** for improved performance and maintainability.

### **📌 Exporting Questions**  
To **export** questions from SQLite into categorized JavaScript files:  
```bash
node src/admin/db-tools/export_questions.mjs
```

### **📌 Updating Questions**  
To **update** the SQLite database with the latest classified questions:  
```bash
node src/admin/db-tools/update_questions.mjs
```
These scripts **keep the database structured and up to date**.

### **🤖 AI-Powered Question Review (Advanced)**

For maintainers, experimental scripts `review_questions.py` and `refine_questions.py` use the Perplexity AI API to automatically review and enhance questions within a specific category.

**⚠️ Warning:** These scripts modify question files directly and rely on an external AI service. Use with caution and review the changes carefully.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3 installed.
*   Node.js installed (for subsequent database updates).
*   Perplexity AI API Key: Set the `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable.
    ```bash
    export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
    ```

**Usage for `review_questions.py`:**
1.  Ensure your API key is set as an environment variable.
2.  Run the script from the project root directory, specifying the category (matching the `.mjs` filename without the extension):
    ```bash
    python review_questions.py --category <CategoryName>
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```bash
    python review_questions.py --category Kubernetes_Security_Fundamentals
    ```

**What it does:**
1.  Identifies questions in `src/exported-questions/<CategoryName>.mjs` needing review (where `revision: 0`).
2.  Sends batches of these questions to the Perplexity API for improvements (clarity, explanations, sources).
3.  Creates a backup (`.bak`) of the original `.mjs` file before making changes.
4.  Updates the `.mjs` file with the AI-revised questions (setting `revision: 1` and `revision_date`).
5.  Automatically runs `src/admin/db-tools/update_questions.mjs` and `src/admin/db-tools/export_questions.mjs` to update the SQLite database and re-export the files.
6.  Saves suggested PR messages summarizing changes to `src/revised-questions/pr_messages_<CategoryName>.txt`.
7.  If any critical step fails, it attempts to restore the original `.mjs` file from the backup. On success, the backup is removed.

**Usage for `refine_questions.py`:**
1.  Ensure your API key is set as an environment variable.
2.  Run the script from the project root directory, specifying the category (matching the `.mjs` filename without the extension):
    ```bash
    python refine_questions.py --category <CategoryName>
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```bash
    python refine_questions.py --category Kubernetes_Security_Fundamentals
    ```

**What it does:**
1.  Identifies questions in `src/exported-questions/<CategoryName>.mjs` needing review (where `revision: 1` by default).
2.  Sends batches of these questions to the Perplexity API for targeted improvements (clarity, correctness, deprecation, sources).
3.  Creates a backup (`.bak`) of the original `.mjs` file before making changes.
4.  Updates the `.mjs` file with the AI-revised questions (setting `revision: 1` and `revision_date`).
5.  Automatically runs `src/admin/db-tools/update_questions.mjs` and `src/admin/db-tools/export_questions.mjs` to update the SQLite database and re-export the files.
6.  Saves suggested PR messages summarizing changes to `src/revised-questions/pr_messages_<CategoryName>.txt`.
7.  If any critical step fails, it attempts to restore the original `.mjs` file from the backup. On success, the backup is removed.
